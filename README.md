This is 'pinput', a graphical frontend to xinput to easily turn off a
mouse or keyboard. It is indeed a very simple program. If you aren't
careful, you may be turning off all important input devices to your X
server. It really is a very, very simple program. So remember: With
great simplicity comes great power...
